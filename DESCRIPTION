Title: Useful functions for creating visual/generative art
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mathias Isaksen
Maintainer: Mathias Isaksen <mathiasleanderi@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains a set of functions that are useful
    when creating visual/generative art. At the moment, most of the package
    deals with polygons/shapes, exposing functions that allows the user to
    do boundary interpolation, corner rounding, deformation and geometric subdivison.
    There are also functions for rescaling values, and creating images based on
    functions that map pixel locations to colors.
    Vectorization is used throughout the package, leading to efficient code.
    The package is a work in progress, and will be updated as soon as more
    functions are ready.
